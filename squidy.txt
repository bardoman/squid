SQUIDZ model
Use a net of nodes to create relations between URLs that have no internal links to each other.
To model connections.
This may be possible with only html.
Perhaps a php database of SQUIDZ models stored away with dynamic code constructing pages on the fly.
You would want to access it with a browser.
Allow the user to update the model if they have authority.
Perhaps use a git back end.

Node ID,   URLs,                  links,    comment
1          http://sdf.org1,...    2,3       idea1
2          http://sdf.org2,...    3,4       idea2
3          http://sdf.org3,...    4,5       idea3
4          http://sdf.org4,...    5,6       idea4
5          http://sdf.org5,...    6,7       idea5
6          http://sdf.org6,...    7,8       idea6
7          http://sdf.org7,...    8,9       idea7
8          http://sdf.org8,...    1,5       idea8
9          http://sdf.org9,...    6,4       idea9

Number of possible links between nodes=> LinkCnt = n (n-1)/2
(look at the simplex prj code)
since nodes are ideas they can contain any number of external URLs
For instance node 5 may have the comment "differential equ".
The URL list may contain any set of URLs pointing to pertenant pages.

One possible network of nodes:

 1  -   2  -   3
 |      |      |
 4  -   5  -   6
 |      |      |
 7  -   8  -   9

Use the http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/index.html as an example of how this might be done.
However using external content.
